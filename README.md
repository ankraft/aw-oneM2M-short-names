## Installation & Maintenance

### Installation

- Clone the repository or download the file [aw-oneM2M-short-names.alfredworkflow](aw-oneM2M-short-names.alfredworkflow)
- Install the workflow in Alfred by double-clicking on it.


### External Tools
- **jq - Command line JSON processor**  
The workflow requires the [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) command line JSON processor. You need to install it separately, for example via brew (see [https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/jq)).

      brew install jq

### Updating the Attribute Mappings

The attribute mappings and information are located in the file *attributes.js* in the workflow directory. An updated version can always be generated by using the script from the [IoTKETI/oneM2M_TS-0004_def_extractor](https://github.com/IoTKETI/oneM2M_TS-0004_def_extractor) project.



## Usage

- Keyword trigger in Alfred: ```sn```
- Pressing ```return``` copies both the long and the short name to the clipboard.


## Roadmap

- Add <flexContainer> specializations from TS-0023.
- Keep the attribute mappings up-to-date.
