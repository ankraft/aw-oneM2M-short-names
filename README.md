## Installation

### Installation

- Clone the repository or download the file [aw-oneM2M-short-names.alfredworkflow][workflow]
- Install the workflow in Alfred by double-clicking on it.


### External Tools
- **jq - Command line JSON processor**  
The workflow requires the [jq][jq] command line JSON processor. You need to install it separately, for example via brew (see [jq Homebrew formulae][jq-brew]).

    	brew install jq

The workflow by default expects ```jq``` in the directory ```/usr/local/bin```, but this can be configured in the workflow.


## Usage

- Alfred keyword trigger in Alfred: ```sn```
- Pressing ```return``` copies both the long and the short name to the clipboard.
- Modifier keys for the search result:
	- Alt: show attribute categories
	- Cmd: show documents where an attribute is defined


## Updating Attribute Mappings

The attribute mappings and information are located in the file [attributes.json][attributes] in the workflow directory. An updated version of this file can always be generated by using the script from the [ankraft/onem2m-extract-attributes][onem2m-extract-attributes] project. It then needs to be copied to the workflow's installation directory.
